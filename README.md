## About BloodHQ
A logistics app using drones to tackle the numerous challenges facing blood distribution from blood banks to locations where they are needed. The app connects hospitals and other licensed medical operators with available blood banks and runs a smooth delivery of blood from blood banks to hospitals. This app will locate nearby blood banks, find available blood match and then have a drone pick up the blood(s) and deliver to location where they are needed. Since a drone is most likely to take a crow fly, this reduces the waiting time between request and delivery of blood pants.
